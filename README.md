### Recursive training

This was part of the course of JS by The Odin Project.
The idea was to practice recursion making:

1. A fibonacci recursive function
2. A merge sort 

In this practice I've improved sorting arrays and how to merge them by recursive ways, using array methods and manipulating them.
